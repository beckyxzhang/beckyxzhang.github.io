        <h2>Neural Networks Project Proposal</h2>
        <h3>An investigation into the ethics behind Spotify's recommendations</h3> 

        <p>The Spotify algorithm is increasingly depicted as a Leviathan that both depresses and 
            drives our experience and enjoyment of music today. I've started reading about the deep learning
            mechanisms behind Spotify's recommendations in order to better understand the algorithm behind it and 
            hopefully develop a thorough analysis, critique of, and response to its flaws. The first article 
            I found was written by a former Spotify intern and is provides a detailed report of the work he did with NN, though it was
            published way back in 2014 and Spotify has amassed much more power and algorithmic capacity since 
            then. I hope to use the tools and theory learned in class to
            explore in more concrete detail some of the blind spots in their deep learning and propose solutions 
            where I can.
            </p>
        
        <p>Goals:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify and analyze key blind spots to their deep learning algorithms.</li>
            <li>Unpack how these blindspots have greater ramifications for the streaming services industry</li>
            <li>Propose solutions or alternative approaches.</li>
        </ol>
