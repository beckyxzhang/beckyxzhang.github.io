        <h2>Neural Networks Literature Review</h2>
        <h3>An ethical investigation into Spotify recommendations</h3>

          <p>This Stanford research paper by a Spotify engineer presents logistic matrix 
            factorization as a tool for collaborative filtering, one of the three deep 
            learning tools Spotify uses to make recommendations based on implicit user feedback data. 
            This offers a more concrete explanation of one way to effectively conduct collaborative filtering.

          <p>This research article highlights a key flaw to collaborative 
            filtering models: their reliance on existing implicit user data generates
             recommendations biased toward older and more popular songs, compromising 
             and actively reducing the diversity of music which people using their 
             recommendations consume. We haven’t been able to read past the abstract, 
             however, because we don’t yet have access to the full paper.

          <p> Spotify uses a combination of collaborative filtering, NLP, and content-based recommendation (which this post is about). 
            The audio signal of one million songs on Spotify was used to train a neural network, of which different convolutional 
            layers seem to recognize certain aspects of the music.

          <p>This post had a general overview of Spotify and its Discover Weekly feature. 
            It went into additional detail about the issues of the “cold start problem” 
            and outlier detection in recommendation decision making processes.</p>

          <p> This is another more general overview of Spotify’s deep learning processes, with 
            some helpful diagrams and explanations of such things as “cultural vectors” defined 
            using NLP and user and song vectors and their matrix operations in collaborative filtering. 
            It also mentions Spotify’s acquisition of music intelligence company The Echo Nest, which 
            was central to its initial success in generating superior recommendations.
