        <h2>Neural Networks Project Outline</h2>
        <h3>Project Name: An ethical investigation of Spotify recommendations</h3> 
        <p>Group Members: Becky Zhang and Alex Franklin</p>
        <p>Much of our consumption of music is dictated by the neural networks behind streaming service recommendations 
            and the user data that they collect. The architecture of these neural networks has real-life implications based on
            biases in the data and the way they are manipulated. One challenge in addressing these issues is the information gap
            on what these neural networks actually look like, and another is the positive feedback loop generated where 
            existing user data for certain songs/artists help to drive users toward the very same content (thus generating more data
            which does the same, and so on so forth),
            rendering less popular or newer music less easily recommendable. We will first have to develop a more concrete 
            understanding of how these neural networks are working (what kind of data and tools they're using) and also 
            the goals and decisionmaking processes of Spotify's dev team, to the best of our ability. Our aim is to unpack 
            how Spotify uses neural networks to generate music recommendations, identify key blind spots and biases, and 
            assess the broader ethical implications of these, proposing solutions where possible.</p>
